# The Ten Minute Bible Hour Podcast Archive

## 📖 Introduction

This project is an unofficial archive of "The Ten Minute Bible Hour Podcast" hosted by Matt Whitman. The goal is to create a comprehensive, searchable database of all podcast episodes, complete with transcriptions generated by OpenAI's Whisper. This will serve as a valuable resource for listeners who want to search for specific topics, revisit favorite episodes, or study the content in a written format.

## ✨ Features

*   **Database:** Organizes episodes by season and stores metadata such as title, publication date, and audio URL.
*   **Transcription:** Uses OpenAI's Whisper to generate a full text transcription for each episode.
*   **Searchable Interface:** (Future Goal) A simple interface to search through the episode transcriptions.

## 💻 Technology Stack

*   **Python 3.13:** The core language for the project.
*   **Feedparser & sgmllib3k:** For parsing the podcast's RSS feed.
*   **OpenAI Whisper:** For generating audio transcriptions.
